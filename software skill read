Leadership Styles

Lewin's Leadership Styles

Psychologist Kurt Lewin developed his framework in the 1930s, and it provided the foundation of many of the approaches 
that followed afterwards. He argued that there are three major styles of leadership:

1. Autocratic leaders make decisions without consulting their team members, even if their input would be useful. 
This can be appropriate when you need to make decisions quickly, when there's no need for team input, and 
when team agreement isn't necessary for a successful outcome. However, this style can be demoralizing, 
and it can lead to high levels of absenteeism and staff turnover.

2. Democratic leaders make the final decisions, but they include team members in the decision-making process. 
They encourage creativity, and people are often highly engaged in projects and decisions. As a result, 
team members tend to have high job satisfaction and high productivity. This is not always an effective style to use, 
though, when you need to make a quick decision.

3. Laissez-faire  Add to My Personal Learning Plan leaders give their team members a lot of freedom in how they do their work,
and how they set their deadlines. They provide support  Add to My Personal Learning Plan with resources and advice if needed, 
but otherwise they don't get involved. This autonomy can lead to high job satisfaction, but it can be damaging 
if team members don't manage their time well, or if they don't have the knowledge, skills, 
or self motivation to do their work effectively. (Laissez-faire leadership can also occur when managers don't have control 
over their work and their people.)

Six Emotional Leadership Styles

Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis, and Annie McKee detailed their Six Emotional Leadership Styles  
Add to My Personal Learning Plan theory in their 2002 book, "Primal Leadership."

The theory highlights the strengths and weaknesses of six common styles – 
Visionary, Coaching, Affiliative, Democratic, Pacesetting, and Commanding. 
It also shows how each style can affect the emotions of your team members.

1. Visionary. This style is most appropriate when an organization needs a new direction. Its goal is to move people towards 
a new set of shared dreams. “Visionary leaders articulate where a group is going, but not how it will get there – 
setting people free to innovate, experiment, take calculated risks,” write Mr. Goleman and his coauthors.

2. Coaching. This one-on-one style focuses on developing individuals, showing them how to improve their performance, 
and helping to connect their goals to the goals of the organization. Coaching works best, Mr. Goleman writes, 
“with employees who show initiative and want more professional development.” But it can backfire if it’s perceived 
as “micromanaging” an employee, and undermines his or her self-confidence.

3. Affiliative. This style emphasizes the importance of team work, and creates harmony in a group by connecting people 
to each other. Mr. Goleman argues this approach is particularly valuable “when trying to heighten team harmony, 
increase morale, improve communication or repair broken trust in an organization.” But he warns against using it alone, 
since its emphasis on group praise can allow poor performance to go uncorrected. “Employees may perceive,” he writes, 
“that mediocrity is tolerated.”

4. Democratic. This style draws on people’s knowledge and skills, and creates a group commitment to the resulting goals. 
It works best when the direction the organization should take is unclear, and the leader needs to tap the collective 
wisdom of the group. Mr. Goleman warns that this consensus-building approach can be disastrous in times of crisis, 
when urgent events demand quick decisions.

5. Pacesetting. In this style, the leader sets high standards for performance. He or she is “obsessive about doing things 
better and faster, and asks the same of everyone.” But Mr. Goleman warns this style should be used sparingly, 
because it can undercut morale and make people feel as if they are failing. “Our data shows that, more often than not, 
pacesetting poisons the climate,” he writes.

6. Commanding. This is classic model of “military” style leadership – probably the most often used, but the least often effective.
Because it rarely involves praise and frequently employs criticism, it undercuts morale and job satisfaction. 
Mr. Goleman argues it is only effective in a crisis, when an urgent turnaround is needed. Even the modern military has come 
to recognize its limited usefulness.
